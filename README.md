# Liver-transplant-survival-predicter AI

## Overview
This project aims to predict liver transplant survival with in Post-op (90 days). This project was conducted by feeding over 200 different medical parameters (Blood type, Age, Sex, History of drug use, etc.) from the donor and patient into different machine learning algorithms. Then based on the results, the most optimal machine learning algorithm was selected to predict patient survival after a liver transplant surgery.


## Machine learning algorthims tested
- Support Vector Machines (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid)
- Multilayered Perceptron
- SGD classifier

## Data
The liver dataset was not posted due to the size of the dataset, although some partial datasets are posted.
The full list of medical parameters used in this project are located in the All_features.csv file

## Summary
The Multilayered Perceptron machine learning algorithm performed the best with a 96.71% accuracy rate in predicting liver transplant survival in Post-op.
