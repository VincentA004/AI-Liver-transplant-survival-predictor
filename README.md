# Liver-transplant-survival-rate

## Overview
This project aims to predict if a patient will die within Post-op (90 days) of a liver transplant surgery. This project was conducted by feeding over 200 different medical parameters (Blood type, Age, Sex, History of drug use, etc.) from the donor and patient into different machine learning algorithms which allows us to find the most optimal machine learning algorithm to predict patient survial after a liver transplant surgery.


## Machine learning algorthims tested
- Support Vector Machines (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid)
- Deep neural networks
- SGD regression

## Data
The liver dataset was not posted due to the size of the dataset, although some partial datasets are posted.
The full list of medical parameters used in this project are located in the All_features.csv file
